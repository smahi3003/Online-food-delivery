# Online-food-delivery

**Introduction**

In the era of digital convenience, online food ordering has become an integral part of modern lifestyles. Understanding the demographics, behaviors, and correlations among customers can provide valuable insights for businesses aiming to enhance user experiences and tailor their services. In this analysis, we delve into a dataset containing customer details related to online food orders. The exploration spans demographic analysis, geographic insights, customer behavior examination, correlation investigations, and the development of a machine learning model for predicting online food orders.

**Dataset**

The dataset under examination comprises 388 rows of customer information, ranging from age and gender to geographic coordinates and feedback. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for gaining insights into customer behavior patterns and making informed business decisions. I got the dataset from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/onlinefoods.csv

**Aims and Methodologies**

The primary objectives of this analysis include:

1. **Demographic Analysis**: Uncover key demographic characteristics such as age distribution, gender ratios, marital status, common occupations, income levels, educational qualifications, and family sizes. The notebook with code and insights can be found here [03A](https://github.com/smahi3003/Online-food-delivery/blob/main/NBS/03A_demographic_analysis.ipynb)
2. **Geographic Analysis**: Explore the geographic distribution of customers, identify clusters based on latitude and longitude, and analyze customer concentrations in specific pin code areas. The notebook with code and insights can be found here [04A](https://github.com/smahi3003/Online-food-delivery/blob/main/NBS/04A_geographic_analysis.ipynb)
3. **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Investigate online food order placement trends, feedback distributions, correlations between demographics and feedback, and patterns in feedback based on age, gender, occupation, etc. The notebook with code and insights can be found here [05A](https://github.com/smahi3003/Online-food-delivery/blob/main/NBS/05A_customer_behavior_analysis.ipynb)
4. **Correlations and Relationships**: Assess correlations between age and monthly income, relationships between marital status and family size, connections between educational qualifications and occupation, correlations between geographic location and feedback, and explore relationships between online food orders and other variables. The notebook with code and insights can be found here [06A](https://github.com/smahi3003/Online-food-delivery/blob/main/NBS/06A_correlation%26relation_analysis.ipynb)
5. **ML Online Model Predictor**: Develop a machine learning model to predict online food orders based on customer details. The notebook with code and insights can be found here [07A](https://github.com/smahi3003/Online-food-delivery/blob/main/NBS/07A_prediction_model.ipynb)
